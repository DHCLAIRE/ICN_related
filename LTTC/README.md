LTTC的writing方向總結
vocabulary level (at least university level)
implicit learning on word learning(from context comprehension)
novelty & contextual diversity effect on word learning (with controlled neighborhood density)
CD & SD could facilitate word-form or phonological representation learning
semantic/concept understanding or context comprehension have multiple level, which require more detailed examination
visual >> exclude neighborhood density effect on recognition
listening >> Controlled PhonLev = neighborhood density is controlled 
complete random design
