## Abstract
- [ ] Revised Abstract

## Introduction
- [ ] Word learning on WF effect/SD effect (implicit learning)
- [ ] novelty & contextual diversity effect on word learning (with controlled neighborhood density)
- [ ] Semantic diversity evaluation /(semantic distinctiveness) >> CD & SD could facilitate word-form or phonological representation learning
- [ ] vocabulary level (at least university level)
- [ ] the use of language model (word2vec/word embedding)
- [ ] Aim of this study

## Methods
  ##  Exp 1
- [x] `1st draft` Participants
- [x] `1st draft` Stimuli (Material preparation & Semantic similarity_USE model
- [x] `1st draft` Procedure  (complete random design`NEED TO INCLUDE`)
- [ ] Data analysis (LMM)
- [ ] Results
  - [ ] Behavioral (CD effect)
  
  ##  Exp 2
- [ ] `NEED revised` Participants
- [ ] `NEED revised` Stimuli (Material preparation & Semantic similarity_USE model
- [x] `1st draft` Procedure  (complete random design`NEED TO INCLUDE`)
- [ ] Data analysis (LMM & MNE-Python & )
- [ ] Results
  - [ ] Behavioral (CD effect)
  - [ ] MEG source localization (CD effect)

## Discussion
- [ ] SD Effect on word learning
- [ ] 2nd language word embedding model could be use on ESL word learning performance
- [ ] Future direction & limitation

LTTC的writing方向總結
vocabulary level (at least university level)
implicit learning on word learning(from context comprehension)
novelty & contextual diversity effect on word learning (with controlled neighborhood density)
CD & SD could facilitate word-form or phonological representation learning
semantic/concept understanding or context comprehension have multiple level, which require more detailed examination
visual >> exclude neighborhood density effect on recognition
listening >> Controlled PhonLev = neighborhood density is controlled 
complete random design
```
